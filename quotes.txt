Let Yourself Relax
Find Your Peace
Breathe Deeply
Embrace the Moment
Stay Present
Dawn hums softly
Shadows breathe peace
Between steps: eternity
The door remembers
Moonlight rearranges silence
Almost home, stranger
Echoes taste like yesterday
Wait at the threshold
Night drips upward
What the fog keeps
Train whistles through nowhere
Signs blink off—hello?
Clock ticks backward sometimes
Static sings of elsewhere
Corridors curl like smoke
Your reflection waved first
Pause, the world buffers
Light pools, unexplained
Exit signs dream too
Almost answered—listen
