Let Yourself Relax
Find Your Peace
Breathe Deeply
Embrace the Moment
Stay Present
Dawn hums softly
Shadows breathe peace
Between steps: eternity
The door remembers
Moonlight rearranges silence
Almost home, stranger
Echoes taste like yesterday
Wait at the threshold
Night drips upward
What the fog keeps
Train whistles through nowhere
Signs blink off—hello?
Clock ticks backward sometimes
Static sings of elsewhere
Corridors curl like smoke
Your reflection waved first
Pause, the world buffers
Light pools, unexplained
Exit signs dream too
Almost answered—listen
Dawn rearranges the corridor
Between blinks you vanish
Elevator hums lullabies
Shadows swap faces quietly
The hallway exhales lavender
Mirror waves before you
Staircase forgets its direction
Neon drips into nowhere
Silence folds like paper
Clock forgets its numbers
Door sighs when questioned
Night leaks from corners
Static tastes like yesterday
Echoes wear your shoes
Pause, the world buffers
Almost home, stranger
Fog keeps its secrets
Train whistles through yesterday
